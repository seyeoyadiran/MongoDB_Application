# MongoDB_Application

Welcome to my MongoDB application. 

## Objectives
- Create a server application with Node, Express, and MongoDB.
- Create a CRUD API using Express and MongoDB.
- Create MongoDB indexes.
- Use MongoDB indexing to make efficient queries.
- Create MongoDB validation rules.
- Use MongoDB validation to ensure data consistency.


Type "npm run dev" in your terminal to run application
You may need to edit the .env file to your Mongodb_URI to get MONGODB backend connecting

Side note if you want to use the app and use the admin options then you would need to go into index.ejs and register an account
- Then to see the options to add, delete, or edit, then you would go to localhost:3000/admin  or localhost:3000/dashboard to delete and edit posts after creating an admin account
